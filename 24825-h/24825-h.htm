<h2>PREFACE.</h2>


<p>The following lines were written under the powerful
impulse of feelings which appear to have been
almost consentaneous with those of the whole British
people. The national spirit has been rouzed
against this cruel and unconstitutional attack upon
the <span class="smcap">Queen</span>, with pervasive ardour, which forcibly
recalls the language of the Augustan poet:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Spiritus</span> intus alit, <i>totamque infusa per <small>ARTUS</small></i>,<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><span class="smcap">Mens</span> agitat <small>MOLEM</small>, et <i>magno se corpore miscet</i>.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>This irresistible movement has been one of <small>LOYALTY</small>,
not of <small>FACTION</small>; of love and not of enmity towards
the constitution. It is not disputed that factious
men exist, who are ready to swell public tumult
whenever it arises: but it is mere drivelling, for ministers
and their adherents, to talk of &ldquo;<em>radicalism</em>&rdquo;
and <em>democracy</em> on this occasion. They must know, if
they consult the commonest sources of intelligence
open to them, that detestation of &ldquo;<span class="smcap">The Bill of
Pains and Penalties</span>&rdquo; is rooted beyond all possibility
of eradication in the breasts of an overwhelming
majority of good men, and faithful subjects.</p>

<p>At the moment when it was determined to send
the following &ldquo;<span class="smcap">Vision</span>&rdquo; to the press, a burst of
honest exultation has electrified the whole kingdom.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[Pg&nbsp;iv]</a></span>
With feelings of solemn gratitude to God, and love
for my country, I rejoice not only that the <span class="smcap">Queen</span>
is thus delivered from the fangs of her enemies; but
that <span class="smcap">the King</span>, <small>THE CONSTITUTION</small>, and <small>THE COUNTRY</small>,
have been thus, as I do unequivocally believe,
rescued from a tremendous explosion, which would
at best have been of doubtful issue to our liberties.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding this most happy, this <em>providential</em>
result, I have determined still to send out the poem
to the public; because it expresses in strong, however
inadequate language, sentiments which are
essential to our character as a free people, and to
the preservation of our justly balanced monarchy.</p>

<p>I have not assumed the <small>FASCIS</small> of satire, without
deep conviction that its rods were imperatively
called into action: but most gladly shall I reverse
them, after the manner of the ancient <span class="smcap">Lictors</span>, over
the obsequies of an administration, which must be
now in its death-pangs. May succeeding cabinets
be <small>WARNED</small>, <em>not guided</em>, by its example!</p>

<h3><i>A VISION.</i></h3>


<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i1"><span style="font-size: x-large;">A</span> vision came! It was not in the hour<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of sleep; but when the unresisted power<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of magic Fancy, threw, with full control,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her half prophetic mantle o&rsquo;er the soul.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The place was thron&rsquo;d like Britain&rsquo;s royal halls,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And her proud navy deck&rsquo;d the tap&rsquo;stried walls.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Statesmen and heroes grac&rsquo;d the pictur&rsquo;d scene;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fathers who were what since their sons have been;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And some whose laurell&rsquo;d brows might glow with shame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of sons with nought of their&rsquo;s besides the name.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In this august abode the loud debate<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seem&rsquo;d hush&rsquo;d, and prince and peer in silence sate;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">E&rsquo;en G&mdash;ff&mdash;d&rsquo;s brazen descant seem&rsquo;d to fail,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And gasping C&mdash;pley gazed on L&mdash;d&mdash;rd&mdash;le;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Panting, they loll&rsquo;d their contumelious tongues,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And suck&rsquo;d <em>Italian juice</em> to clear their lungs.<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg&nbsp;6]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Y&mdash;k mus&rsquo;d on <em>armies</em>; yet, with doubtful trust,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wish&rsquo;d he were certain, or the cause were just:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The eye of Cl&mdash;r&mdash;nce fiercely rang&rsquo;d the floor,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But soften&rsquo;d as it fell on D&mdash;n&mdash;ghm&mdash;re;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While L&mdash;v&mdash;rp&mdash;l, who inly seem&rsquo;d to fear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For place and power, his fellows strove to cheer<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With sickly smile; and courtier lords obscene,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Temper&rsquo;d new filth, to daub their libell&rsquo;d <span class="smcap">Queen</span>.<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">Sudden amid the peers whom <span class="smcap">England</span> hails<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><span class="smcap">Her</span> nobles&mdash;men who fail but when <small>SHE</small> fails,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The vision rose. It was a rev&rsquo;rend form<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of aged dignity: its eye was warm<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With kindlings of a spirit that of old<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Made those walls tremble through its earthly mould.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now a mild glory round its presence play&rsquo;d,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And &rsquo;spoke from heav&rsquo;nly courts the awful shade.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Its brow wore high reproof; the lifted arm<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was stretch&rsquo;d for pleading; and there was a charm<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of coming eloquence, as firm it stood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like one whose rank was with the great and good;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And well that rank was own&rsquo;d, when <span class="smcap">Erskine</span> cried,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis England&rsquo;s <span class="smcap">Chatham</span>!&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Chatham</span>!&rdquo; all replied.<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg&nbsp;7]</a></span>
<span class="i1">Like the dead stillness of the summer air,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When pregnant clouds of shrouded fire are there,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They sat:&mdash;and like the voice of thunder broke<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The rolling periods, as the vision spoke.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Is this,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;the consecrated floor,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where England&rsquo;s peerage stood, as known of yore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Jealous of honour, zealous for the laws;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Justice their sword, and England&rsquo;s weal their cause?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are these the walls whose echoes then return&rsquo;d<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No words that chasten&rsquo;d gallantry had spurn&rsquo;d?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is this the throne whose last loved tenant view&rsquo;d<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His people&rsquo;s morals as the monarch&rsquo;s good?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Display&rsquo;d beneath the sov&rsquo;reign diadem,<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><span class="smcap">Domestic virtue</span>, Britain&rsquo;s dearest gem;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bade <em>Example</em> to <em>his</em> court proclaim<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What taught, unpractis&rsquo;d, is the teacher&rsquo;s shame?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ah no! that throne is chang&rsquo;d; this gew-gaw thing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Befits a raree-shew, not England&rsquo;s King!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And can it be that Brunswick&rsquo;s cherish&rsquo;d heir<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will also change the laws which plac&rsquo;d him there?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forget the <span class="smcap">Stuart&rsquo;s fate</span>, the <span class="smcap">Brunswick&rsquo;s oath</span>;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet make his sorrowing subjects dwell on both?<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg&nbsp;8]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Forbid it, Heaven! Far other thoughts he knew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When yet his talents with his graces grew;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When Genius, Beauty, in his circle ran,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Admired the prince, and half adored the man.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor now <em>thus</em> fall&rsquo;n!&mdash;Yet whence this hot cabal<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of treasury bench, and bench episcopal?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These monstrous portents that before me rise<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of mitred pimps, and coronetted spies!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This deep, dark plotting, spreading net and snare,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By hands that used their country&rsquo;s ark to bear?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This hateful truckling to misguided power,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Combined in palace, temple, hall, and bower,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To crush an outcast Queen, with evidence<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By facts refuted, ridiculed by sense?&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tales that would merit but an equal fate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Told of the veriest wench in Billingsgate!<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><span class="smcap">Fathers</span>! and <span class="smcap">Britons</span>! whence this alien band<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of miscreant lechers bribed from sea and land?&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By England spurn&rsquo;d, yet plied with England&rsquo;s gold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till every scoundrel&rsquo;s stock of oaths was sold;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then hither sent by hirelings vile as they,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To pass for sterling truth in open day.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Monstrous fatuity! and British peers<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Have lent these vermin not unwilling ears;<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg&nbsp;9]</a></span>
<span class="i0">For new-born lies have barter&rsquo;d ancient law,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Broke public faith, to patch a private flaw,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And made a court that freemen never saw.<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><span class="smcap">Accusers, Jury, Judges</span>, <em>all in <small>ONE</small></em>!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O England! now be firm, or be undone!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Strangle this monster, ere its birth be o&rsquo;er,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or grov&rsquo;lling lick the dust to rise no more!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Heard I aright? and was it <small>HERE</small> I heard<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This crew &rsquo;gainst England&rsquo;s <span class="smcap">Consort Queen</span> preferred?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here did their sland&rsquo;rous breath infest the air?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hence did malicious tongues the scandal bear?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gush&rsquo;d &rsquo;neath this sacred dome the prurient flood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of filth and venom, from that viper brood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which o&rsquo;er the land hath spread its noisome stain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While shudd&rsquo;ring virtue weeps, but weeps in vain?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And (O shame&rsquo;s nauseous dregs!) did noble lips<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here taste that stream with epicurean sips?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And mitred heads, as o&rsquo;er its scum they bent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Snuff the rank steam, and chuckle at the scent?&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My soul is sick!&mdash;I turn with sated ear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And find a cordial in my brethren here.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Peers who their conscience to no market bring;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Respect themselves, their country, and their king:<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg&nbsp;10]</a></span>

<span class="i0">The breath&mdash;the very atmosphere of stews.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O horrid! yes, I feel the blast impure,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Air no blessed spirit may unpained endure:<br /></span>

(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to

Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg

     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
